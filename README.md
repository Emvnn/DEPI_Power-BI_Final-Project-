# Manufacturing Downtime

**Manufacturing downtime** refers to the period when production in a manufacturing facility stops or slows down. This can occur due to planned reasons (such as maintenance, upgrades, or scheduled breaks) or unplanned reasons (such as equipment failures, shortages of raw materials, or unexpected issues).

Tracking and analyzing downtime is essential for:
- Improving production efficiency
- Reducing unexpected costs
- Ensuring timely delivery of products
- Optimizing resource allocation
